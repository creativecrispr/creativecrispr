      <h1>About the course and requirements<a class="anchor" id="0.1"></a></h1>

          <p>The CRISPR Course is an educational module for artists and the general public who are interested in genetic engineering and want to explore CRISPR-Cas9 technologies in a creative context. No prior knowledge about biology or experience in the lab is needed to participate. This pilot course was developed during Hybrid Lab Network activities, and it was tested with students, teachers, and people from different countries and backgrounds.</p>

          <p>The Hybrid Lab Network is a multidisciplinary experimentation project with participants from arts, science and humanities backgrounds from 4 countries: i3S in Porto, University of Aalto in Helsinki, Alma Mater Europea in Ljubljana and Waag in Amsterdam. The Hybrid Lab Network builds STEAM (Science, Technology, Arts and Math) education tools around CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genetic engineering for different target groups to teach knowledge and skills but also to promote discussion and critical thinking regarding this emerging biotechnology.</p>

          <p>CRISPR-Cas9 is a genetic modification tool that has revolutionized biological sciences, medicine and the development of biotechnological products, but it is also catching the attention of different fields. The difference with earlier gene editing tools compared to CRISPR-Cas9 is the specificity, ease of use and broad application of its uses.The importance of this genome editing technique was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020 which was awarded to Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna. However, the skills and knowledge necessary to develop new applications for CRISPR are confined to a small group of people with molecular biology backgrounds and access to expensive biolabs. In order to have a more diverse discussion about its applications and possible creative uses, the knowledge and labskills required should be shared with a broader audience. Therefore, this course teaches people without a biology or technological background about the basics of genetics, how CRISPR-Cas9 works and how to use a lab to apply this technique in practice. Furthermore, we will explore ways how this technique could be applied in the future to have a more diverse and informed discussion on these new gene editing technologies.</p>

          <p>The CRISPR Course is developed as a pilot course for people without a biology or technological background who are interested in exploring CRISPR-Cas9 technologies in a multidisciplinary context including art, design and biology. It is a combination of lectures, workshops and laboratory practicals to provide a basic understanding of the CRISPR-Cas9 System and discussion of potential applications and further exploration of the theme.
          This course does not require prior knowledge or skills in biotechnology. Supervision and guidance should be given by expert instructors in the field to ensure a correct understanding of the theoretical concepts and to support the hands-on activities, especially the biotechnology techniques related to gene editing. The provided lectures can be used as a start to explore the topics. Basic lab equipment and supplies for molecular biology practical work are needed, a list of materials and minimum hardware needed for the practical work is provided with possible suppliers. Lastly, the instructional guide for the practical sessions with preparation activities is provided to implement this course to their own environment.</p>
