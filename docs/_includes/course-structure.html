<h1>Course structure<a class="anchor" id="2.0"></a></h1>
	
		 <p>This pilot course was designed to allow you to adapt it to your context (country, education level, field of study, available equipment and experts) and so doesnâ€™t have a rigid structure. Instead, we propose a structure of 5 topics with multiple modules in them. These modules are all 4 hours long and are built up with different teaching activities. These 5 topics are designed to be followed in order to build upon earlier acquired knowledge on biotechnological subjects. You could follow all the modules per topic or just pick one or two that best suits your learning goals and material limitations. Below you can find a general organisation of topics:</p>
  
		<ul>
			<li>Introduction: The lab as a creative space</li>
			<li>Hardware: Making your lab</li>
			<li>Wetware: Growing in your lab</li>
			<li>Genetic engineering: Creative CRISPR</li>
			<li>Personal project</li>
		</ul>
 
		<p>You can easily adapt the program to your personal needs and possibilities by picking and choosing from the modules below. There is a time estimation given and the type of activity. All modules are designed to interweave theoretical, practical, scientific and artistic contents and approaches. As long as you keep the topics 1-5 in that order, you can pick which modules you want to combine or leave out to make a custom program tailored to your audience.</p>
 
		<p>There are multiple types of learning events, with different types of student autonomy and required materials. The modules are built up from less to more autonomy.</p>

		<p>Material requirements: A Computer Practical requires a pc or laptop for the student, a lab practical needs a lab or place to work cleanly with biological materials. For the required materials for the educator, please see the Materials section for this module.</p>

 
		<p>Please keep in mind that everybody participating in a Lab Practical must have done a BioSafety Instruction. Also, the basic lab practices would be highly recommended to finish the Lab Practicals in the required time.</p>
