 	<h3>1. Objectives<a class="anchor" id="1.1"></a></h3>
  
	   <p>The CRISPR Course aims to promote a broader understanding of this novel gene editing tool by teaching practical lab skills, conceptual knowledge and providing a critical learning environment. After learning about the technological, ethical and artistic possibilities and limitations of CRISPR-Cas9, the students can participate in the broader public discussion on genetic engineering. This STEAM module for non-formal education is a multi-disciplinary tool to explain the core concepts of CRISPR-Cas9 through an art & science approach, addressing connections between the artistic approach and core biological concepts. It aims to equip the students with the ability to understand complex biological mechanisms through different creative applications. The course combines several STEAM subjects, hands-on molecular biology lab skills are combined with critical and creative thinking together with collaboration, reflection and communication methods to develop and conceptualise new ideas with CRISPR-Cas9 as a tool.</p>

	   <p>The following general objectives can be listed: 
	    <ul>
	      <li>To familiarise students with standard operating procedures of working safely in a biological lab environment.</li>
	      <li>To explore the possibilities and limitations of standard biological laboratory equipment.</li>
	      <li>To familiarise students with the good lab practices when making media, growing living organisms and working aseptically.</li>
	      <li>To develop a basic understanding of biological theory about evolution and genetics.</li>
	      <li>To highlight the contribution of several artistic practices in the bioart field.</li>
	      <li>To explore the science-society implications of new biological technologies</li>
	      <li>To familiarise students with concepts, core problems, basic knowledge inherent to gene editing and CRISPR.</li>
	      <li>To develop the knowledge and skills to critically contribute to the societal debate on gene editing and genetic modification.</li>
	      <li>To further develop and expand the open-source knowledge of the community.</li>
	    </ul>

    <h3>2. Learning outcomes & competences<a class="anchor" id="1.2"></a></h3>
